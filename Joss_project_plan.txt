Each node will take input from flask webserver, and display output there
	Alt: just take input output to command line
Each node will have an object that will be the rafted thing,
	this object will have a list of all changes and the index
	of the last input change to the node's redis
	...this is actually pretty similar to CQRS and Event Sourcing
		that was on the test, so we can mention that our take is 
		based on this
Will have some threads working
	one will be input/output, flask if thats the direction we are going
	one will be inputting to redis, if len(history) > index, input redis, index++
